# The Odin Project Testing Practice project Assignment Documentation

This assignment includes the implementation of several functions and an object along with their respective tests. Below is a brief overview of each component:

## Functions

### capitalize

This function takes a string as input and returns it with the first character capitalized.

### reverseString

This function takes a string as input and returns it reversed.

### calculator

An object containing functions for basic arithmetic operations:

- `add`: Adds two numbers.
- `subtract`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- `divide`: Divides the first number by the second.
- `multiply`: Multiplies two numbers.

### caesarCipher

This function takes a string and a shift factor and returns the string with each character shifted. It implements a Caesar cipher.

### analyzeArray

This function takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties:

- `average`: Average value of the numbers in the array.
- `min`: Minimum value in the array.
- `max`: Maximum value in the array.
- `length`: Length of the array.

## Testing

Tests have been written for each function to ensure their correctness and functionality. The tests cover various scenarios such as empty inputs, edge cases, and normal use cases.

### How to Run Tests

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the test command (e.g., `npm test`).

## Usage

To use these functions in your project:

1. Import the necessary function(s) from the provided utility file.
2. Call the function(s) with appropriate arguments.
